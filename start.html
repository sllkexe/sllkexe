When you use the internet, you leave digital footprints that can be tracked and used to target you with personalized ads or even steal your identity. To protect your privacy online, you can use strong, unique passwords for your accounts and enable two-factor authentication when available. Be cautious about the information you share online, and consider adjusting your privacy settings on social media and other websites to limit who can see your information. Use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet connection and prevent third parties from monitoring your online activities. Finally, regularly review and update your privacy settings and be mindful of the websites and apps you use to minimize the amount of personal information you share online.</p>
